# CodeMirror

Idea:

Around 24M students don't have proper access to computers. Due to this, students are compelled to write the code on paper. therefore we came up with an idea of a web application, where students with knowledge of any programming language can upload their handwritten code and test it against the compiler.
User can also view their previously scanned/ code history on the web app.

Tech Stack:

React JS, Node JS, Express JS, Google cloud vision API, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, JDoodle API.

What will the end project look like?:

The end project will be a web application, where you can upload your Image of handwritten code and then test it against the compiler. You can also view the history of your scanned code and then, can copy the compiled code or save it.
